#here you might thought this problem is terible but once you start understanding the problem then it is piece of cake for you 
this question might seems long but when you know about the "manhattan distance" then the answer is just in your mind and
actually they already had provided the hintor we say link of the "manhattan distance".

tips : once you start getting the grasp of the problem use your knowledge step by step , apply whatever comes in your mind
       see whether your doing it write or it is going in another direction (do dry run) you will what a useless tip 
       but it is easy problem though but sometimes it is difficult to not getting what you already know and that's the problem i'm faced or even can say im facing.
       

select  round((max(lat_N)-min(lat_n)) + (max(long_w)-min(long_w)),4)
from station;
