#this quetion seems bit different but it'll not because you have to first know what is "Euclidean Distance" you 
dont then not to worry ,they alreadyd give link to it.
and if you solving question sequencely then you'll get answer right away after seeing the question 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance

select round(sqrt(power(min(lat_n) - max(lat_n),2) + power(min(long_w) - max(long_w),2)),4) 
from station;

#explaination:
min(lat_n) => min is for min value in the column lat_n
and as well max()
solve the question with trail and error when ur just learning
after i want to square the "min(lat_n) - max(lat_n)" (i started googling about how to square in SQL then i got the power(column,raised to) raised to= 2 {like column raised to 2 ,column raised to 3 i think you got it!}
so  i used "power(min(lat_n) - max(lat_n),2)" 
and after that squart root the whole damn thing 
and thank god there was "SQRT" for square root  and i used it 
sqrt(power(min(lat_n) - max(lat_n),2)
and finally round it to 4 decimal digit round(column,4) here i need 4 digit decimal that's why i used 4 if you want 5 then you have to use 5
that's all you will get answer:
if you want further explaination comment and i will
