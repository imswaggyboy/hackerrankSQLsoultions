#here i didnt used my brain for the shortcut i.e direct use of max aggregate 

select round(lat_n,4) as lat
from station
where lat_n < 137.2345 
order by lat_n desc
limit 1;

/*#here is the another soultion for the mentioned problem, here i used the max aggregate function and i think it is simple */

select round(max(lat_n),4) as lat
from station
where lat_n < 137.2345;
